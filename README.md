## General info
Owing to COVID19, since it is not possible to conduct programming hackathons, which provide opportunities to meet other programmers directly and grow one's programming ability for novice programmers, we created a platform 'Forecst' that opens hackathons for them. 

Forecst helps users to get easily motivated to keep doing their work on their project by seeing the freely, easily shared development processes and compete with others through the ranking made at the end of the hackathon. Users can also grow a 'forest' together, which is a collection of 'trees'(an object that the user gets to grow through earning points by doing some activities in the platform) of each user.

## Status
Project is: _in progress_, _finished_, _no longer continue_ and why?

## Inspiration
Programming alone and finishing a project at home due to COVID19 have a high rate of failure due to the lack of motivation and laziness and leads to no progress on one's programming ability.
### Present the identified tasks and explain why they matter.

1. give **external motivation** to programmers finishing the project
    - Unlike camps, where we have to present our projects with each other on the due date,  in COVID 19 situation programmers have less motivation for finishing the project.
2. motivate programmers to **freely share** their own coding experiences(success or failure) to each other to develop smoothly
    - It is hard to share their programming ideas or knowledge through online. Being able to share ideas and collaborate with others helps you develop smoothly.
3. make programmers to eagerly participate with **common goals** like a camp through online
    - In this COVID 19 situation, there are rarely programming camps held for programmers, thus an online and remote service similar to those camps is needed.
